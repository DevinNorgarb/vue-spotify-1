## Vue Spotify Client
A Spotify client web app with some features missing from the official Spotify apps on the roadmap. [Demo](https://spotify.alexpepper.us)

## Motivation
The ability to shuffle all the tracks in a playlist folder was removed from the Spotify mobile apps, and that was a feature I used frequently. I started this project primarily to get that functionality back on my mobile phone.

Unfortunately the Spotify Web API does not currently expose any information about playlist folders, so until there's an API change to resolve [this issue](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/38), we've decided to build a custom folder hierarchy stored in the application's database.

## Code style
This project uses [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/standard/standard), enforced (so far only in the front end) by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

Use of ES6+ features in this project is encouraged.

## Features
* Control Spotify from a web interface and play tracks in desktop browsers
* Build folders shuffle all playlists in them

## Roadmap
* Remove requirement to create application account before linking spotify
* Export all your playlists to JSON
* Find official music videos on YouTube for playlists 
* Integrate Chromecast for YouTube videos

## Prequisites
* MongoDB
* NodeJS
* PM2 (for production deployment)

## Installation

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexanderpepper/spotify-utils.git;
```

Install NPM packages
```bash
cd spotify-utils
npm install
cd client
npm install
```

## Configuration

### Create Spotify App
0. [Create a new Spotify app](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
0. Note your Client ID and Client Secret
0. Click "Edit Settings" and add `http://localhost:8080/callback` to the Redirect URIs

### Configure Application
* Create `/server/constants/credentials.js` with the following content:
```javascript
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
module.exports = {
  clientSecret: '<your_client_secret>',
  clientId: '<your_client_id>',
  redirectUri: isProd ? 'https://yoursite.com/callback' : 'http://localhost:8080/callback'
}
```
* An admin account is created on the first run. Default credentials are
  * Email: admin@admin.com
  * Password: admin1234
  * Default admin account credentials can be configured in `server/boot/admin.js`

## Development
Running the server and client as separate processes gives the best development experience with hot reloading in the client app.

The client app is
* Configured in `client/config/dev.env.js` to use `http://localhost:3000/api` as the base API path when running in development
* Configured in `client/config/prod.env.js` to use `/api` as the base API path when built for production

## Running the Server in Development
To run the Loopback server in devepment mode on `https://localhost:3000`:
```bash
node .
```
Loopback uses swagger to document the server's REST API. This can be viewed at `http://localhost:3000/explorer`

## Running the Client in Development
To run the Vue client in development mode on `http://localhost:8080`
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

## Preparing for Deployment
Acquire a standalone certificate from [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and create `server/ssl-config.js` with the following content:

```javascript
const path = require('path')
const fs = require('fs')
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'

exports.privateKey = isProd ? fs.readFileSync(path.join('/path/to/privkey.pem')).toString() : ''
exports.certificate = isProd ? fs.readFileSync(path.join('/path/to/cert.pem')).toString() : ''
exports.chain = isProd ? fs.readFileSync(path.join('/path/to/chain.pem')).toString() : ''
exports.fullchain = isProd ? fs.readFileSync(path.join('/path/to/fullchain.pem')).toString() : ''
```

## Deploying for Production

When the server starts, `/server/boot/client.js` builds the client app by running `npm run build`  in the `client` folder.

To start the server
```bash
node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 start pm2.json --env production
```

To stop the server
```bash
node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 kill
```

To monitor the server
```bash
node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 monit
```
